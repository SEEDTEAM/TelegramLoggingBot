# TelegramLoggingBot
This Bot is written in Python with the help from the pyTelegramBotAPI.

Let's start by installing everything you need.

# Installation

First of all, you need to install Python3 & the Python package manager

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```

After that you need to install the pyTelegramBotAPI.

```
sudo pip3 install pyTelegramBotAPI
```
Finally clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/aRandomStranger/TelegramLoggingBot/
```

# Getting started

Create 2 new files named "loggingids.json" and "user.txt"
Open the file "bot.py" and replace following IDs with your options:

```
API_TOKEN = 'YOUR TOKEN'
```
This should be your Token received from Botfather.

Also don't forget to replace the Debug Group ID



# Running the Bot

You can one-time run the Bot with the command
```
python bot.py
```

This isn't recommend.
Use something like screen to hold the Bot.
``` screen -S LoggingBot ```
Then just retype the command and you are finished!
